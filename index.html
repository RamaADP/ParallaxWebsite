        <h2>Hello there! This is my FIRST WEBSITE</h2>
        <p> The Finest Poetry Was First Experience. That's what they say when you did something for the first time. For me, this website. It took me around 8 hours to build this website since I have no backround in IT. Fun fact, I study Law in my University. That's why I am so grateful that 
            this website turns out to be what I expected. Being able to finish this project is one of the milestone in my programming journey. 
            <br> <br>
            I also have tiktok account @ramaadp in which I share fitness tips such as muscle building, 
            healthy diet, etc. You can also reach me out at <a href="mailto:ramaanandadientaputra@gmail.com">ramaanandadientaputra@gmail.com</a> and 
            <a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=081222102980">081222102980</a>.
            <br> <br>
            I hope to see you again in my other projects soon!!! Thanks for visiting!!! ^_^.
